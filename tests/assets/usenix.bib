abstract     = {<p>Flat Datacenter Storage (FDS) is a high-performance, fault-tolerant,
                large-scale, locality-oblivious blob store. Using a novel combination of full
                bisection bandwidth networks, data and metadata striping, and flow control, FDS
                multiplexes an application's large-scale I/O across the available throughput and
                latency budget of every disk in a cluster.  FDS therefore makes many
                optimizations around data locality unnecessary.  Disks also communicate with each
                other at their full bandwidth, making recovery from disk failures extremely fast.
                FDS is designed for datacenter scale, fully distributing metadata operations that
                might otherwise become a bottleneck.</p>

                <p>FDS applications achieve single-process read and write performance of more
                than 2 GB/s.  We measure recovery of 92 GB data lost to disk failure in 6.2 s and
                recovery from a total machine failure with 655 GB of data in 33.7 s.  Application
                performance is also high: we describe our FDS-based sort application which set
                the 2012 world record for disk-to-disk sorting.</p>},
